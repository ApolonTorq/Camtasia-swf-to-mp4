# Test Outputs Directory
#
# This directory stores MP4 files and metadata generated during test runs
# for manual review and validation. These are NOT used for automated test
# comparisons - they are saved outputs for you to inspect after tests run.
#
# The test suite generates fresh MP4s in test/temp/ during each run, then
# copies the final results here so you can play them to verify quality.
