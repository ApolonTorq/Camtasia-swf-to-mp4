# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test data and sample files used for automated testing.

## Structure

### `videos/`

Contains sample SWF files for testing the extraction and conversion functionality:

- **Small test files** - Minimal SWF files for quick unit tests
- **Typical Camtasia files** - Representative files generated by Camtasia
- **Edge cases** - Files that test specific scenarios (audio-only, video-only, etc.)
- **Error cases** - Corrupted or malformed files for error handling tests

### `expected-outputs/`

Contains the expected results from processing the test videos:

- **Extracted frames** - Expected frame images from SWF extraction
- **Audio files** - Expected audio output from SWF files
- **Converted videos** - Expected MP4 output for conversion tests

## Usage

Test files should be:

1. **Small** - Keep file sizes minimal for fast test execution
2. **Representative** - Cover typical use cases and edge cases
3. **Documented** - Include comments or naming that explains what each file tests

## Adding New Fixtures

When adding new test files:

1. Place SWF files in `videos/`
2. Generate expected outputs and place in `expected-outputs/`
3. Update test cases to use the new fixtures
4. Consider file size impact on repository and CI/CD performance
